Creating a website is FUN, easy, secure and free!

## Only few steps to have your own hompage

    ```
2. Rename your project
3. Add contents in `./src/{lang}/pages` and `./src/{lang}/posts`
4. Add `WEB_PATH_PREFIX` in GitLab's CI variables.
5. Push it to your own GitLab repo

GitLab CI will do its magic, and in few minutes you will see your page!
